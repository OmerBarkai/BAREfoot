## **BAREfoot_TrainClassifier.py**
This script trains a machine learning classifier to recognize specific behaviors in animals based on features extracted from pose estimation and video data. 

### Key Features:
- Prepares a feature matrix from pose-estimation data (DeepLabCut output) and corresponding videos.
- Integrates behavioral target labels (e.g., manually annotated behavior events) from `.csv` files.
- Trains a classification model using features and target labels.
- Saves the trained classifier model for later use in behavior prediction.
- Saves the model's performance metrics on the test set.
- Saves the feature importance explenation analysis (SHAP) figure.
Optional:
- Saves the learning curve 

### Input Requirements:
1. **Pose Estimation Data**: DLC `.h5` (or `.csv`) files should be in the `project/Videos` folder, alongside their corresponding video files.
2. **Video Files**: Should also reside in the `project/Videos` folder.
3. **Target Files**: Behavior labels in `.csv` format should be placed in the `project/Targets` folder.

## **BAREfoot_AutoScore.py**
This script uses a trained classifier to automatically score behaviors in videos. It predicts behavior bouts and refines them with post-processing filters.

### Key Features:
- Loads a pre-trained BAREfoot classifier model.
- Extracts features from pose estimation and video data using the same pipeline as in the training process.
- Predicts behaviors for each video based on the extracted features.
- Applies post-processing to refine predictions (e.g., removing spurious short bouts, filling small gaps).
- Generates output files with predicted behavior bouts.
Optional:
- Generates a video with frame-by-frame behavior bout labeling, indicating when a specific behavior occurs. 

### Input Requirements:
1. **Video Files**: Should reside in the `project/Videos` folder.
2. **Pose Estimation Data**: DLC `.h5` (or `.csv`) files should be in the `project/Videos` folder, alongside their corresponding video files. DLC pose-estimation can be also done as part of the pipeline. 
3. **Trained Classifier Model**: A model generated by `BAREfoot_TrainClassifier.py`.

### Output:
- Predicted behavior bouts for each video are saved in the output folder.
- (Optional) Labeled behavior video is saved in the output folder.
